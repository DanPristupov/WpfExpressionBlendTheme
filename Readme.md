### How to use that theme in your application?

#### NuGet

To install WPF DarkBlend Theme, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:
```
Install-Package WPFThemes.DarkBlend
```

#### Manually

1. Download the project. 
2. Copy Themes folder with Styles.xaml file to your project. 
In order to use that theme you need just to add a reference to Styles.xaml into the App.xaml file.
So, open App.xaml and add following code:
```
<Application
	...
	<Application.Resources>
		<ResourceDictionary>
           	<ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
				<ResourceDictionary Source="Themes\Styles.xaml” />
			</ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
		</ResourceDictionary>
	</Application.Resources>
</Application>
```

If you want to apply the theme to the control which is derived from Window (for example MainWindow) you must add to corresponding xaml a style definition like following.

```
<Window ... Style="{StaticResource {x:Type Window}}”>
```
That's it.
